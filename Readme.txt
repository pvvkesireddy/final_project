To install and run this Flask-based project on your local machine, you'll need to complete a series of steps to set up the environment, install the necessary dependencies, and configure the application.

Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub or another version control system if you haven't already. Ensure that Python is installed on your machine; this project requires Python 3.6 or later.

Once Python is set up, navigate to the project directory in your command line interface. It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment for this project to manage dependencies effectively and isolate them from your global Python environment. You can set up a virtual environment using Python’s built-in venv module.

After activating the virtual environment, install the project dependencies. These are listed in a requirements.txt file typically found at the root of the project directory. Install these dependencies using pip, Python’s package installer.

The application uses Flask to serve web content, Flask-Login for handling user authentication, and several other libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK for machine learning and natural language processing tasks. It also requires external libraries like pandas for data manipulation and requests for handling HTTP requests if integrating external APIs.

Before running the application, ensure you have configured all necessary settings, such as database configurations and any third-party API keys if the project interacts with external services like NewsAPI for fetching news.

Finally, you can run the Flask application using the command to start the server specified in the Flask documentation. By default, the application will be served on localhost (127.0.0.1) at port 5000, but this can be configured as needed.

Access the web application via a web browser by navigating to the local host address and the configured port. You should now be able to use all features of the application, including user authentication, cyberbullying analysis, and viewing cybercrime news updates.
